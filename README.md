# Cycle-Aware Wellness Planner

A full-stack web app for tracking mood, energy, and menstrual flow across the menstrual cycle.

Users can log daily entries (including backfilled days), visualize daily mood and energy trends by month, and inspect any date across years. The app computes cycle phase and cycle day automatically based on user settings.

Built with Next.js, Supabase (Auth + Postgres), and Recharts. Deployed on Vercel.

This project explores how personal health data can be modeled, visualized, and interpreted over time without oversimplifying variability.
